#Checkers In C++
from Nick Bosley

##Languages
- This project exclusively utilizes the C++ language, with CMAKE generated by the compiler

##Summary
- A mostly complete Checkers game, including jumping this time, simulated using a Boardly object that has a 
2D vector of Shapely pointers, utilizing polymorphism to also contain Piecely functions for some objects.
In short: The Boardly class utilizes Shapely as a component class, Piecely inherits from Shapely and has an extra rank field,
and file input and file output are used to load and save the record of wins and losses.

##Bugs
- No currently known, unpatched bugs
  - However, the computer makes random moves, not too fun or quick.
  - Also, no multi-jumping like a real game of Checkers

##Future Work
- I feel that the board and shapes can be used for other games or for other purposes (i.e. google drawings).
Additionally, the computer player can be greatly increased, and the implementation of color (or graphics) could 
improve readability. Also, multi-jumps are coming the next time I work on this.

- This is an all original by myself, with concepts taught in a CS course at UVM
